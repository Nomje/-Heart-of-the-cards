Bugs:

    If you are fast enough you can select multiple cards instead of just 2 due to the asychronous sections of the code flipping the card and notifiying the player if they found a pair or not. 

Technologies used 

    JavaScript, Html, CSS

Approach taken

    Wireframe

        -a wireframe was developed on whimsical showing general structure of the website plus a flow chart of the basic approach to how the game was supposed to be made.

    Project Structure

        The way the code starts is that tthe webpage is loaded with the back of cards facing the player then we have fuctions to cflip a card and show the assign face up card given. form there the app takes a click event on two cards and checks if you have a pair or not. With the check for a pair we have a function to see if the values between the cards match and if so it well then give an alert to infrom you got a pair or that the cards dont match. as your playing the code has a fuctio to see if you have no remaining pairs if so then the reset button well appear and alert the player you have won.

What Went well 

    getting it so that the back side of the cards showing was the hardest but the most fuflling section og the app.
